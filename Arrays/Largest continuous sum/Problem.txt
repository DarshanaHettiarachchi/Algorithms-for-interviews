Find the Missing Element

Problem
  Consider an array of non-negative integers. A second array is 
  formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random 
  element. Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in 
  the second array.

Example
  Input:
  finder([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[3,7,2,1,4,6])

  Output:
  5 is the missing number
